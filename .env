TEXT='Technics has announced a “standard” version of its new SL-1200 turntable at this year’s CES show in Las Vegas, following the release of last year’s eye-wateringly expensive SL-1200G model.According to Technics’ press release, the new SL-1200GR direct-drive turntable “inherits the technology of the Sl-1200G”, and tweaks the classic design to make its damping abilities “more than twice as good” as the SL-1200MK5, released in 2002. The company hasn’t announced a price for the SL-1200GR yet, but What Hi-Fi believes it will be cheaper than its predecessor, which was launched a year ago.While last year’s limited SL-1200G sold out on its launch in Japan, Technics took criticism for the model’s high $4,000 price tag, especially from vinyl DJs looking to replace their old turntables. Earlier this week, a piece in The New York Times saw Technics’ creative director Hiro Morishita explain why the company had turned away from DJs and towards the audiophile market. “Our concept is analog records for hi-fi listening,” he said. “DJs are fine, too, but as a marketing target it’s problematic. We don’t want to sell the 1200 as the best tool for DJing. The 1200 is the 1200”'
